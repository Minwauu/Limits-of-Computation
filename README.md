# Limits-of-Computation

## The Travelling Salesman Problem:

- Given a list of towns and the distances between each pair oif towns, whta is the shortest possible route that the salesman can use to visit each town exactly once and reutrn to the starting point? —> an intractable problem

  ## Methods
- brute force methods
- heuristic approaches
- not all intractable problems are equally hard
- it may be relatively easy to get an approximate answer that is good enough
- a heuristic approach is one which tries to find a solution which may not be perfect but which is adequate for its purpose
- they can’t guarantee that they get the solution we want, but may get a form of a solution

  ## Non computable problems:

  - four tile problem: we can do it, but computers can’t for example
  - face recognition may once have seemed non computable, but are now routine
  - but, Turing proved that some problems are non-computable
 
## The Halting Problem

- The halting problem: it is impossible to write an algorithm to determine if another
algorithm will finish with a given input. The halting problem demonstrates that there are
some problems which cannot be solved by computers.

## Translating assembly code

- All programs have to be translated into machine code before they can run
- Assembly language is translated into machine code by a program called an assembler
- Typically, one assembly code instruction is translated into one machine code instruction.
- Each type of processor has its own assembly language - dependent on processor.
